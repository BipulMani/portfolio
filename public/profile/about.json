    "about": " Hi, I’m Bipul — a developer who loves building things with code.\n\nThis site is where I collect my personal projects, experiments, and ideas. It’s a bit of a digital playground.\n\n\n\nOutside of tech, I enjoy playing guitar, hiking and reading lots of books. If I’m not coding, I’m probably with my friends outside.",
